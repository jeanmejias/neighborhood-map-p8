# Loughborough recommended Restaurant on google maps / Neighborhood Map (React)

This is my final project in my nanodegree by Udacity. This project is coded in ReactJS. 
This final project 

### Project Overview
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Purpose

This app functionality is to show the recommended restaurant in Loughborough by google map.

## How to install

To install you first need to download by **git clone** or download button. Afterwards you should use **npm i** or **npm install** and then **npm start** to start the project.

### Google Maps

This application uses Google maps to display the markers.

### Foursquare

This application uses Foursquare to get information about the locations.

### Why this Project?
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

### What will I Learn?
You will learn how design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

### How does this help my Career?
React is an in-demand technology for Front-End Web Developers
Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market
